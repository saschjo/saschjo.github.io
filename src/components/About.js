              <h1>About me</h1>
              <p><strong>I'm a passionate human-centered designer specializing in design systems and sustainable, future-proof solutions. With half a decade of experience as a UX/UI Engineer and a lifetime of creativity, I seamlessly bridge the gap between business goals, user and end-product.</strong></p>
              <h3>My approach</h3>
              <p>With a holistic, user-centered approach as my core, I employ UX strategy, design thinking, and an iterative workflow to achieve user needs and business goals. It's important for me to help create warm, safe environments where innovation excels through connection and trust. I enjoy creative, fast-paced environments and pride myself on having a beginner's mindset and being a natural problem solver.</p>
              <h3>Design tools</h3>
              <p>I'm highly proficient in Figma, which is my tool of choice for building components and prototypes. I enjoy lo-fi prototyping by hand and illustrating storyboards and visuals to get stakeholders onboard. I'm passionate about team collaboration, often through leading workshops and design sprints.</p>
              <h3>Development experience</h3>
              <p>I really enjoy designing as I code. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JS, as well as experience with React.js, Angular.js, SASS, Node.js, p5.js, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, C#, Git, Dart, Flutter, Wordpress, and Webflow.</p> 
              <h3>Outside of work</h3>
              <p>I enjoy getting creative any way I can! I love painting, and right now I'm really into working with clay. I love cooking, gaming, playing Dungeons and Dragons and spending time with friends. I also run a Pysselklubb (Craft Club) and make music sometimes!</p>
